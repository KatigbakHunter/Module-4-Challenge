# Module-4-Challenge

Overview: The dataset contained in this repository contains the dataset of schools and students. For the school dataset, it contains the school_id, Highschool name, type of school, size, and budget. For the Student dataset, it contains dataof student names, student id, gender, grade, school name, reading and math scores. 

For this challenge, I collected and combined data from both datasetes to analyse the scores of the students. I also collected data to calculate the total number of unique schools, math and reading grades by grade, lowest perfomance and greatest performance by schools. Along with district and school summary, I included data datailing average math and reading scores.
Resources I used to help me write code are INstructor Drew's speed runs and recorded class sessions. I also used Official Python Docs as a reference to write the code.
